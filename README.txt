CIS2520 Assignment 6 F20

Brayden Yip 1107544

This program can be compiled with 'make all'

I didn't bother with bacon1, but all the other applications have the following executables:

"buildidx": ./buildidx {kv filename} {capacity}
"key2val": ./key2val {kv filename} {key}
"val2key": ./val2key {kv filename} {value}
"actors": ./actors {movie name}

This work is solely my own for CIS2520. If any work was used in the making of
the program, it will be listed below:
